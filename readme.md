EchoMage LinkedIn Customer field module

Notice:
- On the Customer account Dashboar, the field value is displayed on "content".
    if need to be restricted to Dasboard -> ACCOUNT INFORMATION, the template need to be overwrited
- The UnitTest contains only one test suite and one Assert, as no other function to be tested.
- I started to use/learn Integration test with Codecept, but no test added at this module
- I know and use composer, but newer made module with composer file, but i willing to learn

Ps. As on the last time not really worked with Magento, (Symfony 2 and other development), i think the
development of this Module takes a littel more time as usual. However with abauth 1 year (13-14 months)
of Magento development, I dont think that I am Senior Magento developer.
